## Automated Findings / Publicly Known Issues

Automated findings output for the audit can be found [here](add link to report) within 24 hours of audit opening.

_Note for C4 wardens: Anything included in the automated findings output is considered a publicly known issue and is ineligible for awards._

- Lack of support for ERC165
- At initialization, fees need to be < 100% for 100% exposure because the first exposures will be ~100%
- If at some point there are 0 funds in the system itâ€™ll break as `amountToNextBreakPoint` will be 0
- In the burn, if there is one asset which is making 99% of the basket, and another one 1%: if the one making 1% depegs, it still impacts the burn for the asset that makes the majority of the funds
- The whitelist function for burns and redemptions are somehow breaking the fairness of the system as whitelisted actors will redeem more value

Trust assumptions of the system can also be checked [here](transmuter/README.md).
